      <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
      <h5> May 11, 2020</h5>
         <p>The first exercise was a practice for us to try fusion 360, itâ€™s a cinch.After watching few videos in youtube, I started drawing by clicking the create sketch on top left corner. Select which surface you would like to draw then press L on your keyboard to draw the line. </p>
         <p>Using the plan view diagram that they provided, click at the middle point and type the dimensions on the rectangle then select 2-point circle to create the arc between the two lines. Select rectangle from the tool bar to draw the rectangle. Make use of the spacing dimension as a reference to plot the points of the rectangle. Once you have finished the diagram, click finish sketching at top right corner then press q in your keyboard to extrude into a model.   </p>
         <p>I wanted to give my own dimentions for my work so i did this Orthographic Projection so that people could fabricate this product. it is really much simple then using the Autocad. This can be done by simply pressing the file logo on top left corner and select new drawing from the Design.</p>

      <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
      <h5> May 11, 2020</h5>
      <p>Making this box end wrench was interesting for someone who use tools often. the dimensions that they provided helped me to sketch first and made few adjustments to the drawing, but the bar joints are curved then being straight. Thus, I used the fillet option to increase the structural integrity of the wrench. </p>
      <p>You can find the fillet option on top panel under Tools. Then select the four edges of the joint to create a nice arc.</p>

      <h5> May 21, 2020</h5>
      <p>this was much challenging then the past few exercises. thus, I decided to record while doing this. With the help of my lecturer, it was much easier to do. </p>
