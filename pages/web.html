<h2>HTML</h2>
<p> The fullform of HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language. Its a markup language to create and develope website.
   it was developed by Tim berners in 1990, which was used to create electronic documnet to be published at
    their Url. pages can be linked using Hyperlinks. I have tried to do a creative webpage which has cool
    animation like luis from UCLA <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/ucal/students/luis-perez/index.html" >(link)</a>
     but it was too complicated to combine with my current codes so i choose to keep it classic.</p>

<h2>Atom</h2>
<p>There are many text editor but i choose Atom because it has many packages to help users with
their web development. Its good because every web developer can make their own package which solves their problem.
 this atom has a packages which preview the html without opening the web browser. </p>

<h2>Github</h2>
<p>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line
  tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration
   features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project</p>
<hr>
<h2>.CSS</h2>
<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a
   web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media),
    CSS comes through and specifies your document's style—page layouts, colors, and fonts</p>
<hr>
<h2>.Js</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web
   pages interactive. ... Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it from a static
   page into an interactive one</p>
